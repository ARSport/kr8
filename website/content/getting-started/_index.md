# Initializing your Config

Starting in v0.0.2, kr8 includes an `init` command which will initialize your cluster config for you.

```bash
kr8 init repo </path/to/repo>
```

This simply downloads the skeletion config from [here](https://github.com/apptio/kr8-config-skel)

You can also recreate this by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apptio/kr8-config-skel.git </path/to/repo>
```
