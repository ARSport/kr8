# Dependencies

The kr8 binary has a single job: generate manifests. In order to ensure you can create components and install them, you'll need some dependencies.

## go-task

Each component in a kr8 configuration directory must have a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.org). To generate the component, you'll need to install go-task.

See the [go-task installation instructions](https://github.com/go-task/task/blob/master/docs/installation.md) for more information
