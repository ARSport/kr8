# Linux

kr8 is a Go binary, which means you can simply download it from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/apptio/kr8/releases)

RPM and DEB packages are also generated for each release

## Dependencies

Installation with Linux does not pull in the additional dependencies. Please see the [dependencies](dependencies.md) page for more details.
