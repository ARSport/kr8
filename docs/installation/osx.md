## Homebrew

The easiest way to get started with kr8 is to use the homebrew tap. This will install all the tools kr8 depends on for you.

```bash
brew tap apptio/tap
brew install kr8
```

## Manually

kr8 is a Go binary, which means you can simply download it from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/apptio/kr8/releases)

If you choose to install kr8 manually, you'll need to install the dependencies. Please see the [dependencies](dependencies.md) page for more details
